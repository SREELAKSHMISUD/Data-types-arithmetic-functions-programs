## Python Basics: Data Types and Operations
This repository contains Python programs demonstrating basic concepts, including data types and simple operations. In this section, we explore how to work with different data types in Python and perform basic operations on them.

## Description
Understanding data types is fundamental in Python programming. This project covers the basic data types in Python and includes an example program that performs operations on a two-digit number.

## Types of Data Types in Python
# Numeric Types:

int: Integer numbers (e.g., 10, -3)
float: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001)
bool: Boolean values (True or False)

Example: Sum of Digits in a Two-Digit Number
This example program demonstrates how to work with strings and integers in Python. It takes a two-digit number as a string, extracts the individual digits, converts them to integers, and calculates their sum
